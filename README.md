# Process-Scheduling-Algorithms

The data.csv contains data about the incoming processes in tabular format.
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Process ID</th>
    <th>Arrival Time</th>
    <th>CPU Burst</th>
    <th>Priority</th>
  </tr>
</table>
These are the supported algorithms:
<ol>
  <li>First Come First Serve</li>
  <li>Shorted Job First</li>
  <li>Round Robin</li>
  <li>Priority Scheduling</li>
  <li>Shortest Remaining Time First</li>
  <li>Longest Remaining Time First</li>
</ol>

The priority field is used only in the Priority Scheduling algorithm.

Compile and Run the main.c file. The result is stored in the result.txt file. It describes the Gantt chart, Average Waiting Time, and Average Turnaround time for the given scenario in data.csv.
